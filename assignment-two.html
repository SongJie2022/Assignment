            This data analysis report is based on 1040 data scrapped from
            Openrice. After the process of removing duplicate values and
            nulling, there are 840 pieces of valid data. The data visualization
            is realized by python, and SQL performs data analysis.

            1. How are the ratings, number of reviews and price per capita of
            restaurants in Yuen Long District distributed?
          </h3>
          <h4 class="detail">(1) Distribution of scores</h4>
          <img class="picture" src="distribution_of_scores.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The restaurant ratings are mainly concentrated in 3.5 and 4 points;
            these two score groups account for 74.4% of the overall. It roughly
            follows a left-skewed normal distribution. The data reflects that
            most restaurants can basically meet users' expectations and reach
            the average score.
          </p>
          <h4 class="detail">(2) Distribution of the number of comments</h4>
          <img
            class="picture"
            src="distribution_of_the_number_of_comments.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <p>
            The number of restaurant reviews is mainly concentrated in the range
            of 0-300, with a few in the range of 300-600. Compared with the
            mainland public reviews, the average number of reviews in the range
            of 1000-2000 reflects that Openrice has room for improvement in
            motivating users to comment.
          </p>
          <h4 class="detail">(3) Distribution of price per capita</h4>
          <img
            class="picture"
            src="distribution_of_prices_per_capita.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <p>
            The price per capita and the number of corresponding restaurants are
            roughly inversely proportional. The lower the price per capita, the
            more restaurants there are. The higher the price per capita, the
            fewer the number of restaurants. This is also in line with our
            intuition that restaurants with high per capita prices are suitable
            for a small number of people and a small number of scenarios, so the
            number is low. The restaurants with less than 100 per capita, which
            account for 75% of the total number of restaurants, are the daily
            consumption places for the general public.

          <h3 class="subtitle" id="Q2">
            2. For the restaurants in the Yuen Long district, what is the
            connection between the rating and the number of reviews?
          </h3>
          <img
            class="picture"
            src="the_relationship_between_score_and_number_of_comments.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <p>
            The maximum number of reviews for restaurants with 1, 2.5 and 5
            points did not exceed 20. The number of reviews is too small, so the
            individual reviews produce a significant effect, making the
            reference of the rating questionable. In the 3-4.5 range, on the
            other hand, it can be seen that the number of people's reviews is
            directly proportional to the restaurant's rating. The higher the
            rating of a restaurant, the more likely it is to motivate consumers
            to go for it. More consumers mean more possibility of reviews.

            3. For restaurants in the Yuen Long district, what is the connection
            between rating and price per capita?
          </h3>
          <img
            class="picture"

            alt=""
          />
          <p>
            The figure shows that price per capita and restaurant rating is
            directly proportional. The higher the price per capita, the higher
            the restaurant rating. The lower the price per capita, the lower the
            rating of the restaurant. This reflects the high rating of the
            restaurant, the high demand in service, environment and taste, which
            brings a good experience to diners. The restaurants with low price
            per capita usually have lower costs, so they spend less on
            decoration and service than the high per capita consumption
            restaurants, and their ratings are not as good as the high per
            capita consumption restaurants.

            5. What are the most popular types of restaurants in Yuen Long
            District?

          <h3 class="subtitle" id="end">Summary</h3>
          <p>
            By looking at the TOP10 restaurants with the highest ratings and
            reviews, we can see the preference of consumers for Japanese food in
            Yuen Long District. Among the ten highest-rated restaurants, there
            are 6 Japanese restaurants. Among the ten restaurants with the
            highest number of reviews, there are 4 Japanese restaurants, all of
            which are among the ten highest-rated restaurants. This also
            validates the conclusion obtained in our visualization that stores
            with high ratings also tend to have a higher number of reviews
            (except for extreme values). In fact, Japanese food is also ranked
            6th among the most popular types of restaurants in Yuen Long
            District. Although Spanish, Peruvian, and Mexican cuisine are in the
            top 3, they all have only one or two stores. Japanese cuisine, on
            the other hand, has 105 stores and stands out in the ranking.
