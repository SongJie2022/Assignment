          Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS (born 8 June
          1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best
          known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is a Professorial
          Fellow of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a professor
          at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Berners-Lee
          proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989, then
          implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext
          Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in
          mid-November.
        </p>
        <p>
          Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
          which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded
          (with his then wife-to-be Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web
          Foundation. He is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's
          chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
          Laboratory (CSAIL).He is a director of the Web Science Research
          Initiative (WSRI) and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center
          for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member of the
          board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and
          president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at
          social network MeWe.
        </p>
        <p>
          He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and
          helped foster the Web's subsequent explosive development. He currently
          directs the W3 Consortium, developing tools and standards to further
          the Web's potential. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign
          Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his
          pioneering work. He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most
          Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of
          other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the "Inventor of
          the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony
          in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer. He tweeted
          "This is for everyone" which appeared in LED lights attached to the
          chairs of the audience. He received the 2016 Turing Award "for
          inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the
          fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".
